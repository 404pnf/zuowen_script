> Notice that a line break in the source does not mean a line break in the output (due to the lazy syntax)!. If you want to have an explicit line break (i.e. a <br /> tag) you need to end a line with two or more spaces or two backslashes! Note, however, that a line break on the last text line of a paragraph is not possible and will be ignored. Leading and trailing spaces will be stripped from the paragraph text.
